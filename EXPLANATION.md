## My approach
- I started by installing and running the status quo, before setting up the GitHub Repository, documenting the original state.
- I am trying to get the basic functionality done, to then refactor & improve 

## Challenges
- the pictures are not loading because of CORS, I chose to copy them locally, for the purpose of this demonstration
- the App.css wasn't loaded and I was getting crazy over the styles not being applied

## Trade-offs (/TODOS)
- using some style library like tailwind would make the whole styles more maintainable
- for now there's a lot of atoms that could get extracted
